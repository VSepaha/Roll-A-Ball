## Instructions and Features
This is a two player split screen game of Roll-A-Ball. The purpose of this game is to get a higher score than your opponents by collecting the cubes. Whichever player has a higher score within a two minute time interval, displayed on the top center of the screen, wins the game.
To start the game, simply click on the start button on the bottom of the game screen.
Once the start button is pressed it turns into a reset button which, when clicked, restarts the game and brings up the initials conditions from when the game first started.
